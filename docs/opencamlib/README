OpenCAMLib README

1. INTRODUCTION
OpenCAMLib (ocl) is a c++ library for creating toolpaths for cnc-machines
such as mills and lathes.

Unti around July 2011 the project was hosted at
http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/
We are now moving to github:
https://github.com/aewallin/opencamlib

The mailing-list for general development and user-discussion is:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib

SVN commit messages go to a mailing-list:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib-svn

IRC-channel #cam on irc.freenode.net

It's probably a good idea to try to adhere to some coding standard. Maybe this one:

2. CLONING, BUILDING and INSTALLING (on unix/debian-like systems)
 $ git clone git://github.com/aewallin/opencamlib.git
 $ cd opencamlib
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../src
 $ make        (try make -j4 for a faster build if you have a multi-core machine)
 $ sudo make install
will install the ocl.so library and camvtk.py so that any python shell will find them.

if you also want to build the documentation, then run
 $ make doc
 $> make doc-pdf
this should create the ocl manual named "ocl-manual.pdf" in the build/doc directory

using cmake and cpack it is possible to build a binary .deb package with
 $ make package
For uploading debian source-packages to the PPA there is also a custom target
 $ make spackage

The build directory opencamlib/build can be wiped clean ("rm -rf *") and cmake run 
again if/when you want a clean build.

3. Ubuntu 10.04LTS-> install and build
- install 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04LTS
- run update manager and install all suggested updates. reboot.
- using synaptic or apt-get, install the following packages(and their dependencies)
-- build-essential
-- cmake
-- subversion
-- doxygen
-- texlive-latex-base
-- libboost-all-dev
- checkout ocl from svn
-- instructions: http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/source/checkout
- in the /src directory, first run "cmake ." then "make" and then "sudo make install"
-- this should build and install ocl correctly.
