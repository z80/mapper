\item Created full control solution for pneumatic mechanism of variable complexity by designing expandable stackable PCB set consisting of identical PCBs, designed GUI for embedded Linux, communication library based on XMPP protocol, made real time firmware for \char`~10 interconnected by common bus microcontrollers.

\item Achieved high precision with equipment made of the lowest cost components by applying machine learning techniques to calibration process.

\item Reduced hardware design time by making expandable stackable PCB solutions consisting of identical PCBs.

\item Simplified "find the same place" task for AFM after sample reinstallation by making video aligning and navigation by video mode via applying regression by recognizable points.

\item Created from scratch software for controlling Atomic Force Microscope.

\item Reduced AFM modes development time and eased prototyping by implementing scriptable GUI builder and hardware embedded real time scripting language.

\item Reorganaized production and supplies purchase processes by perforing statistical predictive contracts analysis. Made business control software for warehouse keeping, product assembling, purchasing and contracts tracking.
