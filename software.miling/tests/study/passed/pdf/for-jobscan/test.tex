\section{Most recent professional achievements}
\begin{itemize}

\item Reduced development time and eased prototyping by implementing hardware embedded real time scripting language and scriptable GUI builder.

\item Created full control solution for pneumatic mechanism of variable complexity by designing expandable stackable PCB set consisting of identical PCBs, designed GUI for embedded Linux, communication library based on XMPP protocol, made real time firmware for \char`~10 interconnected by common bus microcontrollers.

\item Achieved high precision with equipment made of the lowest cost components by applying machine learning techniques to calibration process.

\item Reduced hardware design time by making expandable PCB solutions consisting of identical PCBs with identical firmware.

\item Simplified "find the same place" task for AFM after sample reinstallation by making video aligning and navigation by video mode via applying regression by recognizable points.

\item Reorganized production and supplies purchase processes by performing statistical predictive contracts analysis. Made business control software for warehouse keeping, product assembling, purchasing and contracts tracking.
