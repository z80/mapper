\section{Summary}
Application software engineer with R\&D experience in software and firmware development for scientific devices with active open source community participation is seeking for a full time position in application development. Experienced in Atomic Force Microscopy, semiconductor Kelvin probe analysis, Raman TERS imaging, electrochemistry, actuators control. I enjoy prototyping and problem solving process, adhere DP principle: don't choose one guess - try them all.

\section{Areas of expertise}
\cvdoubleitem{Crossplatform programming}{GUI, hardware communication}{RPC design}{Sockets, XMPP, ICE, XMLRPC}
\cvdoubleitem{Firmware design}{Real time firmware, actuators control, physical properties measurement, RTOS and bare metal firmware}{Scripting and automation}{Scripting languages, embedded scripting, bare metal firmware scripting}

\section{Personal achievements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created from scratch software for controlling Atomic Force Microscope.
\item Reduced AFM modes development time and eased prototyping by implementing scriptable GUI builder and hardware embedded real time scripting language.
\item Reduced hardware design time by making expandable stackable PCB solutions consisting of identical PCBs. Made it for pheumatics control and stepper motors control.
\item Simplified "find the same place" task for AFM after sample reinstallation by making video aligning and navigation by video mode.
\item Reorganaized production and supplies purchase processes by perforing statistical predictive contracts analysis. Made business control software for warehouse keeping, product assembling, purchasing and contracts tracking.
\item Acheived high precision with equipment made of low cost components by applying machine learning techniques to calibration process.
