\section{Summary}
%Application software engineer with R\&D experience in software and firmware development related to Atomic Force Microscopy, Raman TERS imaging with active open source community participation is seeking for a full time position in application development.

Application software engineer with R\&D experience in software and firmware development for scientific devices with active open source community participation is seeking for a full time position in application development. Experienced in software and firmware development for Atomic Force Microscopy, semiconductor Kelvin probe analysis, Raman TERS imaging, electrochemistry, actuators control. I enjoy prototyping and problem solving process, adhere DP principle: don't choose one guess - try them all.

\section{Personal achievements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created from scratch software for controlling Atomic Force Microscope.
\item Reduced AFM modes development time and eased prototyping by implementing scriptable GUI builder and hardware embedded real time scripting language.
\item Reduced hardware design time by making expandable stackable PCB solutions consisting of identical PCBs. Made it for pheumatics control and stepper motors control.
\item Simplified "find the same place" task for AFM after sample reinstallation by making video aligning and navigation by video mode.
\item Reorganaized production and supplies purchase processes by perforing statistical predictive contracts analysis. Made business control software for warehouse keeping, product assembling, purchasing and contracts tracking.
\item Achieved high precision with equipment made of low cost components by applying machine learning techniques to calibration process.
